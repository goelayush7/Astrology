🌌 AI Astrologer ✨ (LangChain + OpenAI)

A simple AI-powered astrologer app built with Streamlit and LangChain.
It takes user birth details (Name, Date, Time, Place), generates an astrology-style profile, and allows the user to ask one free-text question.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This is a demo project. Outputs are generated by an AI model and should not be taken as professional advice.

🚀 Features

Clean Streamlit UI to collect user input (Name, DOB, Time, Place).

Generates an astrology-style profile (LLM-backed, not rule-based).

Lets the user ask one free-text question and get a supportive response.

Built with LangChain + OpenAI GPT (gpt-4o-mini by default).

Ready for a 2–5 min demo video.

Key Themes

Strengths

Watch-outs

Free-Text Q&A
After generating the profile, you can ask a custom question (e.g., “How does my career look this year?”).
The model uses the profile as context to provide a supportive, 100–150 word response with 2–3 actionable steps.
